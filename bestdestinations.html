          <h1>Solar panels</h1>
          <p>
            As the cost of solar energy has plummeted in recent years
            alongside major improvements in technical efficiencies and
            manufacturing quality, many homeowners across the U.S. are
            starting to look at solar as a viable alternative energy solution.
            And as solar enters mainstream energy markets, the big question
            is, “how do solar panels work?” In this article, we’ll break down
            exactly how solar panels produce energy for your home and how
            pragmatic going solar really is.

          <h1>Charge controller</h1>
          <p>
            A charge controller is an essential part of nearly all power
            systems that charge batteries, whether the power source are solar
            panels, wind, hydro, fuel, or the utility grid. Its purpose is to
            keep your deep cycle batteries properly fed and safe for the long
            term. The basic functions of a controller are quite simple. Charge
            controllers block reverse current and prevent battery overcharge.
            Some controllers also prevent battery overdischarge, protect from
            electrical overload, and/or display battery status and the flow of
            power. Let's examine each function individually.

          <h1>Home Battery system</h1>
          <p>
            A home battery acts like a barrier between your home and the power
            grid. It plugs right into your current electrical system to
            optimize daily energy use and to provide backup power during a
            grid failure. It does this by taking in power from the grid or
            your solar panels and then strategically deploying it on your
            house.

          <h1>DC power</h1>
          <p>
            Direct current or DC electricity is the continuous movement of
            electrons from an area of negative charges to an area of positive.
            A DC circuit is necessary to allow the current or steam of
            electrons to flow. Such a circuit consists of a source of electric
            energy (such as a battery) and a conducting wire running from the
            positive end of the source to the negative terminal. DC
            electricity in a circuit consists of voltage, current and
            resistance. The flow of DC electricity is similar to the flow of
            water through a hose.

          <h1>Inventer</h1>
          <p>
            An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or
            process. The invention process is a process within an overall
            engineering and product development process. It may be an
            improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for
            creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a
            completely unique function or result may be a radical
            breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others
            skilled in the same field. An inventor may be taking a big step
            toward success or failure.

          <h1>AC power</h1>
          <p>
            Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically
            reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with
            time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one
            direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power
            is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of
            electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug
            kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a
            wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a
            flashlight. The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean
            simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or
            voltage.
